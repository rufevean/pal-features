It isn’t just a software development tool, but a complete paradigm shift, and is anticipated to be a disruptive technology, like the automobile was to the horse and buggy.\nIf computer programming languages were flying machines, than all of them would be lighter than air craft. Whether they are procedural, object oriented, functional, or concatenative, such differences between them are the kind of variations between hot air balloons, helium based dirigibles, and hydrogen filled zeppelins.\nThe last 70 years has witnessed an endless variety of tinkering, tweaking, and engineering to make them faster, safer, and able to carry more payloads — but in the end, they all are simply just balloons, in fancy shapes, with fancy fans strapped on to them.\nPAL represents an invention that is a completely new type of flying machine that is nothing like the previous menagerie of “air ships”. It is based on totally new principles and technology which makes it faster, easier and safer to use by orders of magnitude.\nSo, the natural question to ask, is how so? Why are all other computer software languages like air ships (balloons) whereas PAL is like an airplane or helicopter?\nFor the answer we need to consider this point: What is the fundamental thing that they all have in common with each other, which makes PAL unique from any of them? In spite of such diversity, what is the glaring fundamental flaw that unites every existing computer language, no matter whether it be C#, Ruby, Python, Perl, D, Lua, Oberon, Modula, Oz, Pascal, Ada, Prolog, Java, occam, Small Talk, PL/1, Forth, APL, Basic, Algol, Lisp, Cobal, Fortran, …etc.?\nIt is this: Linguistically speaking, they are all syntactic straight jackets. They do NOT allow computer code to mirror and accurately reflect the problem domain in the solution domain. Using these languages is like trying to perform surgery with oven mitts on, or to dance while wearing a parka with scarf and boots. They are clumsy and crude tools to the task. This is why more and more languages keep getting invented and developed. Because none of the languages so far, have been adequate.\nTo be technical, using terms of Concept Programming, they all suffer from high signal/noise ratio (fraction of the code space used for representing actual concepts, as opposed to implementation information), high syntactic noise (discrepancies between the concept and the syntax used to represent it), high semantic noise (discrepancies between the expected meaning or behavior of the concept and its actual meaning or behavior in the code), and low bandwidth (how much of the concept space a given code construct can represent).\nFor concrete examples see this web-link: www.webpage.net\nSo how does PAL address these issues? For the time being, we can’t reveal specific details since PAL is an Intellectual Property that needs to be protected at this time, so we will just list some of PAL’s attributes which give it an unfair advantage over all other computer languages.\nPAL has the following features:\nMost readable code — since it executes “pseudo code” directly.\nFastest development time.\nFastest compilation time.\nMost robust and secure code (certified to be 100% bug free, when no 3rd party code is involved, like outside DLLs, or external APIs.) This is because the PAL team strictly adhere to a zero-bug-tolerance policy.\nOnly language to have fuzzy logic operators — ideal for process control and discreet simulation applications.\nOnly language that supports 2-D operand notation. All other languages are restricted to 1-D notation.\nOnly language to allow creation of new operators as simply as creating new functions.\nOnly language to support operator or function extensioning. Other languages just allow overloading.\nImplicit data flow is prohibited.\nNo limitations on any symbol name; any character and/or glyph can be used.\nAllows all aspects of the language to be modified or redefined whether it be syntax, grammar, vocabulary or functions and operators.\nAllows multiple return values (tuples) for functions and operators.\nHas a minimum set keyword vocabulary since overloading is extensively used. For example, PAL’s version of what is commonly known as a match or case statement, overloads the keyword if with the meaning of ‘‘case’’ and overloads the keyword else with the meaning of ‘‘otherwise’’. (So the additional words of ‘‘case’’ and ‘‘otherwise’’ are not needed.)\nExecutable object code can be decompiled back to source code.\nIs not bound by the Von Neumann bottle neck.\nAllows self-modifying code.\nWill run on any machine architecture; from micro controller firmware all the way to main frame super computer.\nPAL is not just a language or Operating System, it is a philosophy.\nOnce a programmer tries developing software in PAL, he/she will never want to go back to the “old way” of doing things – because the old way sucks!\nTo be Continued …\n",
